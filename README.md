# Robot-Bartender
The aim of the project is to simulate a bartender robot that assembles, mixes and serves cocktails to customers, knowing the recipes and the positions of the ingredients. It is implemented with the Peter Corkeâ€˜s Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB.


giuRobot.m which is the graphical interface that shows the trajectories created by the whole algorithm to prepare 4 cocktails (it needs the .mat files with the names of the cocktails and the run of the Robot.m file that configures the manipulator and the environment) . In the test.m file there are the commands used to test the various functions and the ones used to create the trajectories.

In report.pdf there is all the implementation information.
